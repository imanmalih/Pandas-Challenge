# Pandas-Challenge

Disclaimer: I was guided by AskBCS LA's for a second set of eyes and help with minor errors. I also used a function/method found through google (.nunique).

At first, we analyze an over view of the districts schools by combinning all the schools,student amounts, budgets etc. Then after, we get a little more specific and zoom in on each schools student amount, grades, budgeting, and average scores. To make it a little more legible, we organize the order of the data by the top overall passing percentage. This starts to give us information a little more clear and tells us the schools with the best overall score percentage are charter schools with a budget of $582 per student. It tells us the budgets for the schools does not have to exceed $650 per student in order to have a high passing scores. 
Furthermore, we learn that the bottom performing schools are district schools with the lowest passing percentage being 52.9%. 
These schools are larger and have more students. 
As we continue, we look more into the math and reading scores per grade. 
Notice that they are pretty close in range and do not have big differences per grade range.
With scores based on school spending, we can conclude that the students scores are not any more higher because of spending more per student. 
The data frame that shows scores based on school sizes show us the highest overall passing % is a charter school with 1000 or less srudents. 
In the end, as we look at the final data frame, we conlude the best schools with the highest passing percentage are charter schools.
